# TASK :  Create a "coin toss" promise that resolves or rejects randomly.
### Instructions:
1. Create a new JavaScript file named `coinToss.js`.
2. In this file, create a function named `coinToss` that returns a Promise
3. The Promise should randomly either resolve with the string "Heads" or reject with the string "Tails".
4. Use `Math.random()` to determine the outcome of the coin toss.
5. After defining the function, call it and handle both the resolved and rejected cases using `.then()` and `.catch()`.
6. Log the result to the console.
