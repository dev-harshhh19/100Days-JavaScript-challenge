- Search for current weather by city name
- Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Error handling for invalid city names
- Option to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Background images that change based on weather conditions

---
## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 
- JavaScript (ES6)
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Fetch API for making HTTP requests

---
## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter a city name in the search bar and press Enter.
4. View the current weather information displayed on the screen.
