# Day 59 - Project: Persistent To-Do List

## Overview
In this project, I created a persistent to-do list application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, with all data being stored in the browser's local storage to ensure persistence across sessions.

## Features
- Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
- Data persistence using local storage, so tasks remain even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## concpet I implemented:
- **Local Storage**: Utilized the `localStorage` API to store and retrieve tasks, ensuring that the to-do list persists across browser sessions.
- **Event Handling**: Implemented event Listeners for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Used JavaScript to dynamically create and update HTML elements based on user interactions.
- **CSS Styling**: Styled the application using CSS to create a user-friendly interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Data Structure**: Used arrays and objects to manage the list of tasks efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Browser Local Storage API

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the input field to add new tasks.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed or uncompleted.
4. Click the delete button next to a task to remove it from the list.
5. All tasks will be saved automatically in local storage.
6. Refresh the page or close and reopen the browser to see that your tasks persist.

## Future Improvements
- Add the ability to edit existing tasks.
- Implement task prioritization and categorization.
- Add a search functionality to filter tasks.
